        <p>I am Rita Mumo, a Customer Experience Executive at Safaricom PLC, a major Telecommunications Company in East
            and Central Africa.
            I grew interest in technology and started personal classes on <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?u=70023106">Linkedin Learning.</a></p>

        <p>To be precise I was attracted to <strong>Cloud computing</strong> and got curious to learn and
            understand how cloud systems work.
            Thanks to my current employer's path towards becoming an agile company, I applied for the digital academy
            and got enrolled to learn cloud computing with <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a></p>

        <p>I am eager to learn and finally get to work in technology preferably in cloud projects supporting customer
            experience excellence.</p>

        <p> See what I like. <button type="next"> <a href="page3.html"> Hobbies and Interests </a> </button></p>
