        <p> I have hiked several places in kenya, the above photo being Mt Satima, which is a peak among others in Abadare ranges </p>
        <li> Painting</li>
        <P>During the first peak of CoViD most recreational places were closed down, and I had to find a hobby to put my time into. Thats when I started painting.</P>
